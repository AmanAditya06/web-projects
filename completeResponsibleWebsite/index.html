                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A computer science degree is a common choice for aspiring high-level programmers. Computer science students who earn a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree learn the fundamentals of computer programming as well as the mathematical and scientific principles that provide the underpinnings. Specifically, students become proficient in discrete math—a branch of mathematics that deals with objects that have distinct values—as well as computer organization and architecture, algorithms, programming and software design. Some schools offer Bachelor of Arts (BA) programs in computer science, which typically provide more general education and less math and science. However, each school is different, so students should research the options to determine which programs’ requirements best fit their needs.In addition to coursework, most schools require students to conduct a culminating project that integrates what they have learned over the course of the degree. Typically, students meet regularly with an adviser who gauges their progress and offers advice and guidance. They then present their results in a final paper or presentation.As with a bachelor’s degree, there is no specific computer programming degree at the master’s level. </p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves.A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next.As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.That does not mean, however, that students interested in programming don’t have more advanced options. In fact, computer science degrees at the master’s level provide a breadth of academic knowledge while allowing students to gain depth in a specific area.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technical education, the academic and vocational preparation of students for jobs involving applied science and modern technology. It emphasizes the understanding and practical application of basic principles of science and mathematics, rather than the attainment of proficiency in manual skills that is properly the concern of vocational education. Technical education has as its objectives the preparation of graduates for occupations that are classed above the skilled crafts but below the scientific or engineering professions. People so employed are frequently called technicians. Technical education is distinct from professional education, which places major emphasis upon the theories, understanding, and principles of a wide body of subject matter designed to equip the graduate to practice authoritatively in such fields as science, engineering, law, or medicine. Technical occupations are vital in a wide range of fields, including agriculture, business administration, computers and data processing, education, environmental and resource management, graphic arts and industrial design, and health and medicine; technical educational curricula are correspondingly specialized over a broad range</p>
